# Real-Time-Facial-Expression-Recognition
In this project, I have created convolutional neural networks (CNN) for real time facial expression recognition task. In this we have used dataset of fer2013 which contain 35887 grey 48X48 images. we have used webcam for live prediction of our facial expression.
